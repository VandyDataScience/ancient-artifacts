The purpose of this notebook is to load and clean the data.  It should also test the data (e.g., by assertr) to ensure that assumptions about the data are met, and store the cleaned and tested data.

```{r}
#Import helpful packages
library(haven)
library(vroom)
library(boxr)
library(janitor)
library(assertr)
library(tidyverse)
```
# set working directory
setwd('~/Documents/AncientArtifacts/ancient-artifacts')

# read in each csv file into data frames
LithicData <- read_csv("LithicExperimentalData.csv")
ASData <- read_csv("ArchaeologicalSoilData.csv")

# join data frames and clean column names
ArtifactData <- rbind(LithicData,ASData) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# move filename to first column in data frame
ArtifactData$filename <- filename
select(ArtifactData, filename, everything())
