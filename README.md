# Background  

Mortars keep buildings together; their composition can elucidate who the builders were and how they built. This potential has not been realized fully because it requires analyzing 100s or 1000s of mortar samples objectively. We propose to achieve this with a dynamic image particle analyzer, a novel machine that processes a sample within minutes and measures dozens of variables – e.g., length, height, and transparency – for each particle. Beyond size distribution, we propose to use experimental archaeology to define the characteristics of crushed olive pits and other potential mortar constituents. We test our approach at the ancient port city of Caesarea Maritima in Israel where different cultures left stone buildings between 22 B.C.E. and 1265 C.E. Dynamic image analysis may help to identify construction work standardization as well as different mortar recipes of Roman-Judean, Byzantine, Abassid Muslim, and Crusader builders.

# Scope

If models are performing sufficiently well, publication-quality graphs and summary tables, accompanying methods section. Modeling outcomes of ODI, back pain, leg pain. There is another outcome, satisfaction score. For a later project, possibly return to work (Cox regression modeling). 

# Data

Same data as was used in https://github.com/vanderbilt-data-science/spine. 

## Data security

If there are any security concerns or requirements regarding the data, they should be described here.

## Counts

Describe the overall size of the dataset and the relative ratio of positive/negative examples for each of the response variables.

# Models

Clearly identify each of the response variables of interest.  Any additional desired analysis should also be described here.

# Timeline

Eight weeks. Last week of April for completion.
