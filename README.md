# Background  

Middle of Feb set up analyzer and workstation. 
Start with a specific dataset. For dissertation, small Mayan village, took soil samples from 50 households that made up the village. Who use stone tools? 

Could start these this semester. Run the samples, data end of Feb. Two tasks: management of the data. Set up the database to manage the data. Analyze it. Look for patterns. Can also run samples of the experiments. See what lithic debris to see what it looks like. Look for evidence of lithic microdebitage. <4mm, 1/6th of an inch. Too small to see. Ancient people couldn't remove it from where they were working. In the Mayan area, stoneknappers, they would have cleaned up the sharp debris, most ancient areas, stoneknappers cleaned up, so difficult to know where they working! Know location of marketplaces. 

There are modern stoneknappers, invited to create a new stone tool, and collected microdebitage. Can run through the analyzer, determine what it looks like. Then, validate the models by microscopic expert analysis. 

Determine similarity, percentage composition from the soil site of microdebitage.

# Scope

See above

Analyze 50 samples of soil for evidence of lithic microdebitage. The utlimate goal is to determine which households likely hosts stoneknapping work. 

# Data

Modern stoneknapping, 30-50, representing the stages of specific work (representing what was being done at each stage, all labelled). 50 soil samples from Mayan village. These samples will be analyzed in the PartScan, data structure TBD. 

## Data security

No issures

## Counts

Describe the overall size of the dataset and the relative ratio of positive/negative examples for each of the response variables.

# Models

Clearly identify each of the response variables of interest.  Any additional desired analysis should also be described here.

# Timeline

End of February by the end of February (management is an issue, 100M datapoints)

End of semester for models, predictions, ready for validation (flex time if only undergraduates). 

Algorithm to analyze samples and assign probabilities.
